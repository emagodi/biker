Love this idea — a motorcycle e-hailing app with bidding is actually a really good fit for markets where bikes are faster + cheaper than cars. 🚲🔥
Let’s design it properly, step by step, using the stack you chose. I’ll act like your technical co-founder here.

1. High-level Architecture (clean & scalable)
Tech stack (good choices 👍)

Backend: Spring Boot (Java)

Mobile apps: React Native (Driver + Customer)

Web app: Next.js (Admin + maybe marketing site)

Database: MySQL

Real-time: WebSockets (very important)

Maps & Distance: Google Maps API or Mapbox

Auth: JWT + refresh tokens

Storage: S3-compatible (AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO)

Payments / Wallet: Mobile money / cards (depends on country)

2. User Roles (clear separation)

You will have 4 main roles:

Customer

Driver (Motorcycle rider)

Admin

System (pricing, bidding, matching logic)

Each role should have separate permissions, even if they share tables.

3. Core Features Breakdown
A. Driver (Motorcycle) Registration Flow

Driver signs up:

Name

Phone number (OTP verification)

National ID

Driver’s license

Motorcycle details (plate, model, color)

Uploads:

Motorcycle photo

License photo

Profile photo

Account status = PENDING

Admin reviews

Admin approves → status = ACTIVE

Driver must load wallet/points to receive jobs

🔐 Important statuses

PENDING

ACTIVE

SUSPENDED

REJECTED

NO_CREDIT

B. Customer Flow

Customer signs up (phone + OTP)

Sets pickup location (GPS)

Sets destination

App calculates:

Distance

Suggested price (base fare + distance)

Customer sends request

C. Ride Request + Bidding (Your Unique Feature 💡)

This is the heart of your app.

Step-by-step:

Customer sends ride request

Backend:

Finds nearest available drivers (e.g. 5)

Filters:

ACTIVE

Has wallet balance

Online

Request is sent to those drivers via WebSocket

Drivers:

See pickup, destination, distance

Submit their bid price

Customer sees:

List of drivers

Profile pic

Motorcycle pic

Rating

Bid price

Customer selects a driver

Ride is locked

Other drivers are notified → request closed

⏱️ Add a timeout (e.g. 30–60 seconds) for bidding.

4. Distance & Pricing Logic
Distance

Use:

Google Directions API or

Mapbox Directions API

Calculate:

Distance (km)

Estimated time

Suggested Price (example formula)
base_fare = 2.00
price_per_km = 0.50

suggested_price = base_fare + (distance * price_per_km)


Customer sees this but drivers can bid up/down.

5. Wallet / Credit System (Very Important)
Why this is smart

It:

Prevents fake drivers

Creates revenue upfront

Ensures only serious riders are online

Wallet logic

Driver wallet has:

balance

last top-up

Each ride deducts:

flat fee OR

percentage (e.g. 10%)

If balance <= 0:

driver status = NO_CREDIT

no requests sent

Admin controls:

Top-up rates

Promotions (free credits)

Commission %

6. Real-Time Communication (Critical)

You must use WebSockets.

What uses WebSockets:

Driver online/offline status

Driver location updates

Ride requests

Bids

Ride acceptance

Ride status changes

Spring Boot options:

Spring WebSocket (STOMP)

Or plain WebSocket

Redis (later) for scaling

7. Database Design (Core Tables)
Users
users
- id
- role (CUSTOMER, DRIVER, ADMIN)
- phone
- password_hash
- status
- created_at

Drivers
drivers
- user_id
- license_number
- rating
- wallet_balance
- online_status

Motorcycles
motorcycles
- driver_id
- plate_number
- model
- color
- photo_url

Ride Requests
ride_requests
- id
- customer_id
- pickup_lat
- pickup_lng
- dest_lat
- dest_lng
- distance
- status (REQUESTED, BIDDING, ACCEPTED, CANCELLED)

Bids
bids
- id
- ride_request_id
- driver_id
- price
- created_at

Rides
rides
- id
- ride_request_id
- driver_id
- final_price
- status (STARTED, COMPLETED)

8. Admin Dashboard (Next.js)

Admin should be able to:

Approve/reject drivers

View rides

Set pricing rules

Manage wallet & commissions

Suspend users

View reports

9. Security & Quality (Don’t Skip This)

Phone OTP verification

JWT + refresh tokens

Rate limiting

Location spoofing detection (basic)

Ride history

Driver ratings

Customer ratings

Cancellation penalties

10. Development Roadmap (Very Important)
Phase 1 – MVP (Launch Fast)

Customer app

Driver app

Admin approval

Ride request

Bidding

Wallet deduction

Phase 2 – Improve

Ratings

Chat or call masking

Promotions

Surge pricing

Heat maps for drivers

Phase 3 – Scale

Redis

Kafka (optional)

Microservices

Multi-city support

Next step (let’s actually build)

If you want, we can:

Design REST + WebSocket APIs

Design ERD properly

Write Spring Boot project structure

Define React Native screens

Implement driver matching algorithm

👉 Tell me what you want to design next:

API endpoints?

Database ERD?

Driver matching logic?

Wallet system in detail?

Real-time WebSocket flow?

We’ll build this like a real startup, not theory 💪
